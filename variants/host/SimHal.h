// The hardware RadioLib runs on, when there is no hardware.
//
// RadioLib is written to be ported: everything it needs from a platform is
// behind RadioLibHal, sixteen virtual methods. Implementing them is what lets
// MeshCore's own CustomSX1262 driver - and RadioLib itself - run unmodified
// against a simulated chip, instead of both being replaced by a hand-written
// stub whose behaviour is ours rather than theirs.
//
// Two things here are not obvious and both matter.
//
// **Time is the node's, not the machine's.** millis() and micros() return
// simulated time, because a lockstep simulation is reproducible only if
// everything the firmware can observe comes from the simulation. Wall time
// would make two runs of one seed differ.
//
// **Waiting must always end.** RadioLib spins on the BUSY line and on its own
// timeouts, and a spin that does not advance simulated time never terminates -
// which in this codebase means a frozen window and a control socket that stops
// answering. So every blocking call advances the local clock, and BUSY is never
// asserted: we model command *latency* rather than the BUSY handshake, which
// removes the whole class of hang for something the firmware cannot tell apart.
